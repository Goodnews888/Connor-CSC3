This project is a game I made back in 2023. It's a vocabulary game where the idea of the game is that the application will prompt the user with a alphabetical letter, and the user has to enter a word starting with that letter.
Each word entered will reward the player with a point. Each word entered, the app will prompt the user with a new letter, allowing the user to enter in more words. The goal of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible
under a time limit... Once that time limit is reached, the game halts. There are different difficulties of the game, where the difficulties control the minimum number of letters a word entered can be. As you'd imagine users being
able to enter 1 letter words or even 2 letter words would be far too easy, thus these difficulties are introduced. 

Enjoy!
